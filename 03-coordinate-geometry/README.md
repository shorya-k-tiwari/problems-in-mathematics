# 03 - Coordinate Geometry

This directory explores the **Analytical Geometry** of two-dimensional space. It is the study of geometry using a coordinate system, bridging the gap between algebraic equations and visual curves.

### 🔭 Areas of Focus
* **Linear Systems:** Properties of straight lines, slopes, and angular relationships.
* **Circular Motion & Logic:** Equations of circles, tangents, and normal properties.
* **Conic Sections:** Detailed analysis of the Parabola, Ellipse, and Hyperbola.
* **Geometric Locus:** Solving problems based on the path traced by moving points under specific constraints.

### 🧠 Computational Objectives
The focus in this section is on **Geometric Visualization**:
1. Using `Matplotlib` to render precise conic sections and their intersecting lines.
2. Building scripts to find and verify the properties of tangents and normals at specific points.
3. Solving for the "Locus" of points through numerical simulation to verify analytical derivations.
