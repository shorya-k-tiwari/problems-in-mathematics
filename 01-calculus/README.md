# 01 - Calculus

This directory focuses on the study of continuous change through the lens of **Mathematical Analysis**. The problems here transition from foundational limits to complex differential systems.

### 🔭 Areas of Focus
* **Foundational Analysis:** Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability of single-variable functions.
* **Differential Calculus:** Higher-order derivatives, implicit differentiation, and optimization (AOD).
* **Integral Calculus:** Techniques of integration (Substitution, Parts, Partial Fractions) and Area under Curves.
* **Differential Equations:** Modeling change through first and second-order linear equations.

### 🧠 Computational Objectives
The goal in this section is to use **Symbolic Computation** (`SymPy`) to:
1. Verify analytical solutions obtained through manual derivation.
2. Visualize the behavior of functions near singularities or critical points using `Matplotlib`.
3. Generalize specific JEE/MIT problems into universal solvers.
