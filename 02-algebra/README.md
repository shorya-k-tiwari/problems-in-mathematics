# 02 - Algebra

This directory is dedicated to the study of **Mathematical Structures** and **Discrete Systems**. It bridges the gap between elementary equations and the high-dimensional logic used in Linear Algebra and Modern Computing.

### 🔭 Areas of Focus
* **Equation Theory:** Quadratic, Cubic, and Higher-order polynomials.
* **Complex Systems:** Geometry of the complex plane and De Moivre’s Theorem applications.
* **Matrix Theory:** Determinants, Cramer’s Rule, and the foundations of Linear Algebra (MIT 18.06).
* **Combinatorics & Probability:** Systematic counting (P&C) and the quantification of uncertainty.
* **Series & Progressions:** Limits of sequences and binomial expansions.

### 🧠 Computational Objectives
The focus here is on **Algorithmic Implementation**:
1. Implementing solvers for systems of linear equations using `NumPy`.
2. Visualizing complex roots and transformations on the Argand plane.
3. Simulating probabilistic models to verify theoretical distributions.
