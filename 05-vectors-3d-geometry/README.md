# 05 - Vectors & 3D Geometry

This directory explores **Spatial Mathematics** and **Linear Transformations**. It focuses on the extension of geometry into three-dimensional space using vector algebra—a cornerstone of modern physics and computer vision.

### 🔭 Areas of Focus
* **Vector Algebra:** Dot products, cross products, and scalar triple products.
* **Linear & Planar Logic:** Equations of lines and planes in 3D space.
* **Spatial Relationships:** Calculating distances between skew lines, angles between planes, and points of intersection.
* **Vector Calculus Foundations:** Directional derivatives and the geometric interpretation of vectors in physical systems.

### 🧠 Computational Objectives
The focus in this section is on **Spatial Computation**:
1. Implementing vector operations (cross/dot products) from scratch and verifying with `NumPy`.
2. Visualizing 3D lines, planes, and their intersections using 3D plotting in `Matplotlib`.
3. Building solvers for shortest-distance problems between lines in 3D space, translating vector logic into executable code.
