# 04 - Trigonometry

This directory is dedicated to the study of **Periodic Functions** and **Triangular Relationships**. Trigonometry serves as the primary tool for modeling oscillations, rotations, and spatial orientation.

### 🔭 Areas of Focus
* **Trigonometric Identities:** Manipulation of compound angles and multiple-angle formulas.
* **Periodic Equations:** Finding general and principal solutions for trigonometric systems.
* **Inverse Trigonometric Functions (ITF):** Domain and range constraints with a focus on principal value branches.
* **Geometry of Triangles:** Sine/Cosine rules and properties of circumcircles, incircles, and ex-circles.

### 🧠 Computational Objectives
The focus here is on **Symbolic Manipulation and Modeling**:
1. Utilizing `SymPy` to simplify complex trigonometric expressions and solve non-trivial equations.
2. Visualizing the periodicity and phase shifts of composite functions using `Matplotlib`.
3. Implementing solvers for "Solutions of Triangles" to calculate lengths, angles, and areas from given constraints.
