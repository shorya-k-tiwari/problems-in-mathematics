# Problems in Mathematics

A systematic repository dedicated to the **formalization of mathematical reasoning through computation**. This project serves as a digital bridge between theoretical problem-solving and algorithmic implementation.

---

### 🎯 Project Scope
This repository contains Python-based solutions and visualizations for complex problems sourced from:
* **Advanced Engineering Curricula:** (JEE Advanced level Calculus, Algebra, and Geometry)
* **Academic Frameworks:** (MIT OCW 18.06)
* **Mathematical Olympiads:** (Logic-based challenges and discrete structures)

### 🏗️ Structure
The repository is organized by mathematical branch to ensure systematic navigation and scalability:

* **`01-Calculus`** – Limits, Continuity, Differentiation, and Integration.
* **`02-Algebra`** – Complex Numbers, Matrices, Determinants, and Probability.
* **`03-Coordinate-Geometry`** – Analytical Geometry of 2D and 3D systems.
* **`04-Trigonometry`** – Identities, Inverse Functions, and Equations.
* **`05-Vectors-3D-Geometry`** – Vector Algebra and Spatial Logic.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Symbolic Math:** `SymPy` (for exact solutions and verification)
* **Computation:** `NumPy` (for numerical methods)
* **Visualization:** `Matplotlib` (for geometric and functional plotting)

### 💡 Intent
